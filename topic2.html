        <!--  This is the introduction paragraph that explains the transition from HTTP/0.9 to HTTP/1.0 -->
        <p>
            As the web grew, it became visible that HTTP/0.9 had some problems. When HTTP/1.0 came out in 1996, 
            it was a big deal because it added a lot of important features that changed the web from an easy way 
            to share documents to a place where people could interact with each other and find resources.
        </p>

        <!-- Info about HTTP/1.0 headers and their impact -->
        <p>
            Back when HTTP/1.0 was introduced, it came with metadata headers that gave users a lot more flexibility. 
            These headers could specify things like the type of content being shared and enable caching, which not 
            only improved the user experience but also took some of the strain off servers.
        </p>

        <!-- This part mentions the rise of commercial web browsers -->
        <p>
            Around the same time, we saw the launch of the first commercial web browsers, like Netscape Navigator, 
            which helped make the web even more popular. Users could discover websites with lots of multimedia because 
            HTTP and browsers worked well together.
