        <h2>Scalability and the Arrival of HTTP/1.1</h2>
        <!-- This paragraph discusses how HTTP/1.1 improved web scalability -->
        <p>
            As the web grew very quickly, it became hard to scale and perform efficiently. HTTP/1.0 had limitations that made communication slow and inefficient for bigger sites. When HTTP/1.1 was introduced in 1997, it solved many of these problems. It allowed persistent connections, meaning that browsers and servers could reuse the same connection for multiple requests and responses, reducing delays.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTTP/1.1 also introduced chunked transfer encoding, allowing servers to send data in smaller, manageable pieces instead of waiting to compile a full response. This upgrade made websites faster, especially for streaming video and handling large datasets. It also let servers choose the best response language or format for users based on their browser capabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>The Modern Web: HTTP/2 and Beyond</h2>
        <!-- This paragraph discusses HTTP/2 and new improvements -->
        <p>
            With the rise of mobile devices and data-heavy applications, HTTP/2 was developed to meet modern demands. Officially released in 2015, HTTP/2 introduced features like two-way multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to travel over a single connection at once, improving speed and efficiency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern technology continued to evolve with HTTP/3 and the QUIC protocol, aiming for faster and safer web experiences by reducing setup time and improving encryption automatically. This shows how web standards constantly adapt to make the internet quicker and more secure for users everywhere.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <!-- This is the conclusion that wraps up the research -->
        <p>
            The evolution of HTTP has helped the web become more efficient, flexible, and secure. From the simple beginnings of HTTP/0.9 to the advanced features of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, each version has addressed new challenges and made the web a better place for communication and innovation.
