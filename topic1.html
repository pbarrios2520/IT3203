            <!-- Description of HTTP/1.0 and its purpose -->
            As the web grew, it became visible that HTTP/0.9 had some problems. When HTTP/1.0 came out in 1996, it was a big deal because it added a lot of important features that changed the web from an easy way to share documents to a place where people could interact with each other and find resources.

        <p>
            <!-- This part explains HTTP headers and their impact -->
            Back when HTTP/1.0 was introduced, it came with metadata headers that gave users a lot more flexibility. These headers could specify things like the type of content being shared and enable caching, which not only improved the user experience but also took some of the strain off servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- This part mentions of early web browsers and their role in popularizing the web -->
            Around the same time, we saw the launch of the first commercial web browsers, like Netscape Navigator, which helped make the web even more popular. Users could discover websites with lots of multimedia because HTTP and browsers worked well together.
