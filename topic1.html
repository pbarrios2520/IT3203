        <h2>The Early Web and the Introduction of HTTP</h2>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of using links to talk with people at CERN. This is where the World Wide Web got its start.</p>
        <p>The system was very basic and could only handle GET calls for HTML pages. It was very simple, but HTTP/0.9 set the stage for a standard way to send web data. This made it possible for people to request and view documents online.</p>

        <!-- Subsection about the growth and expansion of the web -->
        <h2>The Expansion of the Web and HTTP/1.0</h2>
        <p>As the web grew, it became visible that HTTP/0.9 had some problems. When HTTP/1.0 came out in 1996, it was a big deal because it added a lot of important features that changed the web into a more powerful and flexible platform.</p>
        <p>Back when HTTP/1.0 was introduced, it came with metadata headers that gave users a lot more flexibility. These headers could specify things like the type of content being shared and enable caching, making the web experience much better.</p>
