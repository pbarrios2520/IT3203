        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Since it started in 1989, the World Wide Web has gone through a lot of big changes. It began as a cool new way to share files and has grown into a platform that nations, businesses, and technologies can't live without. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an important part in the development of the web.</p>

        <!-- Subheading for Key Milestones -->
        <h2>Key Milestones in Web Evolution</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) has evolved from a basic hypertext system to an essential global tool. Below are some of the most significant developments in its history:</p>
        <!--  This is an unordered list of the key important dates -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1989:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee proposes the concept of the World Wide Web.</li>
            <li><strong>1991:</strong> The first-ever website goes live.</li>
            <li><strong>1993:</strong> Introduction of Mosaic, the first graphical web browser.</li>
            <li><strong>1995:</strong> JavaScript is created, making web pages interactive.</li>
            <li><strong>2004:</strong> The Web 2.0 era begins, introducing social media and user-generated content.</li>
            <li><strong>2010s - Present:</strong> The rise of mobile web, AI-driven experiences, and Web 3.0.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Subheading for HTTP's Role -->
        <h2>The Role of HTTP in Web Development</h2>
        <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the backbone of how web pages are requested and displayed. It allows for the transfer of data between browsers and web servers.</p>
        <p>With the rise of security concerns, HTTPS (secure HTTP) was introduced, ensuring encrypted and safe data transmission for users worldwide.</p>

        <!-- Second topic section -->
        <h2>The Early Web and the Introduction of HTTP</h2>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of using links to talk with people at CERN. This is where the World Wide Web got its start.</p>
        <p>Servers and clients could talk to each other through HTTP, which was very important. People could now use the internet to ask for and get info. HTTP/0.9 was the first version and came out in 1991.</p>
